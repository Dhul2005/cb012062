        <img src="images/images7/1.jpeg" alt="Image of Wilpattu Entrance">
        <p>Experience Sri Lanka's most elusive wildlife in the vast seclusion of Wilpattu National Park. Occupying a vast swathe of land bordering the copper-sand beaches of the north west coast, the ancient ruins of the Cultural Triangle and the Northern Province, this is Sri Lanka's largest and oldest game reserve. Home to myriad endemic species, the park fosters sensational bird life, Asian Elephants, Sri Lankan Leopards, Sri Lankan Sloth Bears.</p>
        <p>While Wilpattu was first designated a wildlife sanctuary as far back as 1905, it wasn't until February 1938 that this 13,500-hectare park was elevated to national park status. Yet, its story begins much earlier than this. The copper shoreline of the reserve, specifically at Kudiramalai, a rocky promontory, is widely believed to have been the landing spot of the Indian Prince Vijaya in the 5th century BC. He married Princess Kuveni of Sri Lanka, and together they established the Sinhalese race. The region's alternative name - Thambapanni or the 'colour of copper' - came about due to the reddish colour of the sand that stained the hands and feet of Prince Vijaya and his 700-odd followers when they came ashore. The ruins of Kuveni's palace is just one of 68 archeological sites within Wilpattu National Park.</p><br>
        <p>Wilpattu National Park is in the north west of Sri Lanka, around 35km west of Anuradhapura and 32km north of Puttalam. It takes around 90-minutes to reach the reserve from Uga Ulagalla, and is around a 4-hour drive from Uga Residence in Colombo. From Wilpattu National Park's main entrance at Hunuvilagama, the track weaves through beautiful lowland forest for around 10-kilometres before you reach the more open wildlife areas.</p><br> -->
