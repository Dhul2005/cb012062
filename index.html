      <h2>WHY YOU SHOULD VISIT SRI LANKA?</h2>
       <div class="info">
        <p>Sri Lanka's wildlife is as varied as the island itself, ranging from elephants and leopards to marine life and a vast number of different birds, and Sri Lanka is now one of the best places in the world to see whales, including the mighty blue whale.With 12% of the country designated for wildlife protection, it is easy to get a taste of Sri Lankan wildlife: safari parks and sanctuaries, particularly in the southern and central zones, offer the easiest way to see animals in their natural habitat. Stay alert for a sighting of the endangered leopard; take your time as you watch the elephants feeding and washing in a tank or lagoon, or walk quietly along the beaches of the west and south coast near to marine turtles as they lay their eggs.</p>
