        <h2>Crimson fronted Barbet</h2>
        <img src="images/images5/1.jpeg" alt="Image of a Crimson fronted Barbet">
        <p>This is a small sparrow-sized barbet of striking colouration. However, in spite of its facial colouration of red, orange-yellow, blue, black and green, it often blends inconspicuously with the dense foliage of its preferred habitat. If not for the bird's characteristic calls of pop-op-op-op-op utteredrepetitiously from a prominent bare twig, it would often go unnoticed. At times the bird utters a slow wok, wok, wok call somewhat reminiscent of that of its relative, the similarly sized Crimson-breasted Barbet. The Ceylon Small Barbet lives in pairs, but where food is plentiful such as near a fruiting banyan, flocks congregate to feed on the succulent berries. It is a fruit eater, though young are periodically fed on animal matter such as grasshoppers, moths, at the nest, no doubt to keep their protein requirements fulfilled.</p><br>
        <p>The Ceylon Small Barbet is widely distributed in the low country wet zone and up to the mid hills. It occurs but sparingly in some localities of the dry zone. It is a bird of well wooded country including forest. However, it is not uncommon in well populated towns either, being the only endemic that can be observed in the heart of Colombo.</p><br>
        <p>This barbet nests in a tree hole dug by the birds themselves. In keeping with its size the branch chosen is a narrow one. Most often the entrance is located on the underside of an angled branch. The height may vary from a couple of metres to ten metres or more. Generally two or three white eggs are laid. The incubation period is only about two weeks though the young remain in the nest for at least five weeks. They are coloured mostly dull green all over, with some pale yellow on the face. The breeding season is from about January to June.</p>

        <h2>Red slender loris</h2>
        <img src="images/images5/2.jpeg" alt="Image of a Red slender loris">
        <p>The red slender loris, also known as the slender loris, the Sri Lanka slender loris, and the Sri Lanka wet zone slender loris, is endemic to 100 to 110 different locations throughout Sri Lanka's southwestern wet zone. The region is referred to as the “wet zone” because it receives about 10 feet (3 m) of rain every year. </p><br>
        <p>The red slender loris is the smallest of the slender lorises, with a weight of 3-6 ounces (85-172 grams) and a length of 4.5-6.5 inches (12-17 cm). Females are a little smaller than males and weigh between 3.5 and 5 ounces (103-148 grams).They can live up to 18 years in the wild.</p><br>
        <p>Delicate white markings accentuate the heart-shaped faces of these prosimian primates. With thin hairless round yellow ears on top of the head, disproportionately large forward-facing brown eyes, and a thin long pink wet nose, red slender lorises look like plush toys covered in thick and soft reddish caramel color fur with creamy undersides. They have no tail. Their limbs are gracile and end with highly mobile wrists and ankles. Their tiny hands have flat fingernails and a shortened second digit; their feet have a grooming claw on the second digit. Because the big toe and thumb can be adducted 180 degrees from the other digits, these tiny creatures have an incredibly powerful grip.</p>
        <p>Red slender lorises feed exclusively on prey. They are skilled hunters who delight in eating geckos and lizards but also enjoy various insects such as moths, dragonflies, grasshoppers, and ants. Their forward-facing eyes are an advantage for hunting, since it allows them to see depth. They approach their prey very quietly and grasp it quickly with one or both hands. Their digestive system is such that they can ingest toxic prey without becoming sickened by it.</p><br>
        <p>These nocturnal primates are tree dwellers with an inability to leap, so they are rarely found on the ground. Their home range covers as much 6 acres (2.6 ha) for males and 9 acres (3.7 ha) for females.</p>

        <h2>Sri Lankan Sloth Bear</h2>
        <img src="images/images5/3.jpeg" alt="Image of a Sri Lankan Sloth Bear">
       <p>The sloth bear, the only member of Family Ursidae in Sri Lanka is found in dry zone forest habitats. Shaggy, dusty, and untidy black coat is an unmistakable to spot Sloth Bear. It is solitary by nature and emits noisy grunts and snorts while walking by keeping its nose closer to the ground in search of insects and fresh fruit. Sloth bears feed predominantly on termites and ants which it removes from rotting stumps and termite mounds and employ a well-evolved method to dig them out. In addition to the termites and other insects, sloth bears feast on a variety of fruit that are common in the dry forests.  They spend considerable time on the Palu trees during the fruiting season as the sweetness and the abundance of tiny Palu fruits are simply irresistible.</p><br> 
        <p>Bears consume large quantities of fruits of Palu (Manilkara hexandra), Madan (Szsygium cumini) and Weera (Drypetes sepiaria) during the fruiting season; in turn bear help seed dispersal through defecation. After a six- to seven-month gestation period sloth bears normally give birth to a litter of two cubs in an underground or rocky den. The cubs will often ride on their mother's back, a unique trait among sloth bears. Yala, Wilpattu, Wasgomuwa National Parks are the most popular places to watch Sloth Bears.</p><br>
       <p>Sri Lankan Sloth Bear has thick shaggy fur that is black colored. Its ears are lined with long fur and it has a long snout, a long tongue, round eyes, and a large nose and a V or Y shaped marking on the chest. Its head resembles a domesticated dog. Their paws are equipped with well-developed hooked claws that enable them to climb trees and dig for termites. The head and body grows up to 6 feet in length, and can weigh up to 225-300 pounds for a male and 125-200 pounds for a female.</p><br>
