        "par1"    : "Yala is one of Sri Lanka's oldest national parks and was designated a wildlife sanctuary as far back as 1900 though it wasn't until 1938 that it was established as a national park. Right in the heart of Yala sits the Buddhist temple Sithulpawa, and this former monastery is thought to date back 2,000 years. At one time, the monastery is thought to have housed 12,000 inhabitants, and today, it remains an important temple visited by pilgrims across Sri Lanka. Other significant cultural sites in the vicinity include Kataragama and Magul Maha Vihara.",
        "par2"    : "Yala National Park (otherwise known as Ruhuna National Park) is one of Sri Lanka's must-sees. Located to the south east of the island, this exceptional game reserve is Sri Lanka's most popular for very good reason. Thought to be home to the greatest density of leopards per square kilometre in the world, Yala covers an area of 1,260 square kilometres and is divided into five blocks. Block I is the most visited portion of the reserve and the most rewarding destination for a leopard safari. Leopards are usually elusive, though in Yala, sightings of them are extremely good - you might see them basking in the sun atop rocky outcrops, in trees, crossing tracks and beside waterholes. Alongside leopards, there are also sloth bears, Asian elephants, deer, monkeys, buffalo and many species of birds. If you're really set on seeing leopards, Yala will offer you Sri Lanka's best opportunity.",
        "par3"    : "Yala National Park is located in the south east of Sri Lanka around 20km southwest of Tissamaharama. Part of the reserve borders the Indian Ocean. It takes less than 10-minutes to reach the entrance of the reserve from Chena Huts, which sits in the park's wildlife-rich buffer zone. Colombo is around a 300-kilometre drive away, which takes five hours.",

        "par4"    : "Yala National Park is the best reserve in Sri Lanka for seeing a wide variety of wildlife, and in particular leopards, elephants and sloth bears. There are approximately 215 bird species resident in the park, including seven endemics, along with 44 mammals. The park is divided into five blocks of which block I (where most game drives take place) is renowned for having the greatest density of leopards per square kilometre in the world. Many of the younger males have grown so used to their dominance within the reserve and the jeeps that seek them out that they saunter lazily along tracks and sunbathe on rocky outcrops in full view.",
        "par5"    : "As such, Yala is Sri Lanka's most popular national park, and receives a large number of visitors. Elephants, sambur deer, jackals and langur monkeys also play leading roles in the park, as do elusive sloth bears - small, scrubby looking bears that love to feast on the fruits of the palu tree when in season in May and June. Bird life is also a highlight, and some endemics include the Sri Lanka grey hornbill, the Sri Lanka wood pigeon, the brown-capped babbler and the blue-tailed bee-eater. The rare Black-necked Stork and the greater adjutant are other significant residents of the park, which is also visited by many migratory species.",

        "image3"  : "images/images6/3.jpg",
        "par6"    : "The park is open 6am to 6pm and there are two safaris a day - in the morning and the afternoon. Each catches one of two prime times to see the animals: dawn and just before dusk. During the rainy season (May to August) the early morning safari is better for leopards and bears. Later in the day they can get soaking wet so when the sun rises they always find the places to dry up and get warm up. During the dry season (December to March), the afternoon safari is best. During the day animas tire with the sun and go under bushes for shade and to hide. When sun goes down they always go to the waterholes to drink.",
        "par7"    : "Yala National Park is a vast dynamic reserve, consisting of dense jungle, endless grasslands and several lakes and lagoons. This distinct landscape ensures the perfect habitat for a great variety and density of wildlife, making Yala one of the best national parks in Sri Lanka. But it isn't just the variety of animals that makes Yala National Park so popular. No, it's mostly the fact that it's acknowledged as one of the best spots in the world to see wild leopards.",
        "par8"    : "If you are already located near Yala National Park, this safari can be started. From Tissa and Kataragama, it takes about half an hour to reach the park entrance. If you in Thissamaharama area your easiest entrance is Palatupana entrance.",
        "par9"    : "At early morning, depending on the vehicle queue, you will have to wait to buy your tickets at the entrance. Your driver will buy them for you. Early morning wind could be very chilling, so take a light cardigan with you."
