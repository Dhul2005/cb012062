            <h2>LOCATIONS WHERE LEOPARDS ARE FOUND</h2>
            <section id="leop">
            <h3>Yala National Park</h3>
            <p>Undoubtedly the top spot has to go to Yala National Park, the crown jewel of safari parks in the country. This is truly the land of the leopard, with some of the highest if not the highest densities of these amazing predators in the world. The sightings of a beautiful cat walking across the open plains or atop a rocky outcrop is a signature sight in Yala National Park. Many famous leopards have become household names in Yala. In the past big males such as the “Chaitya Male” (known to have been big and strong enough to bring down an adult buffalo) and Hamu were iconic. At present, a very detailed study on the leopards of the park is being carried out whereby over 130 individual leopards have been identified. Even now, new individuals are keen to get identified, which showcases the vast density of these predators in such as small area which is only 142 Square Kilometers. Some of the notable characters during the present era to emerge from Yala are - Lucas, Julius, Harak Hora, and Aster to name a few. A very informative “Leopard Center” is present in the park where visitors can learn more about these predators and also compare one's sightings with the virtual database and try and identify the leopards they have spotted while on safari.</p><br>
            <h3>Wilpattu National park</h3>
            <p>The land of lakes, Wilpattu is located on the North-Western end of the island. This is Sri Lanka's largest national park and is quite a contrast to the landscape of Yala. Where Yala is mostly dry scrub forest, open lagoons and plains, as well as many rocky outcrops, Wilpattu is denser with dark forests being the dominant landscape, along with few open spaces which are usually consisting of natural lakes known as Villus. The dense dark forests make it quite difficult to see these predators, but when they do come onto the roads it is a sight to behold. The open sand brimmed lakes are some of the most beautiful settings to view these magnificent predators. The park was closed for many years during the time of the civil war and was finally opened to the public in 2010. During this time, the leopards were very shy and sightings were almost nonexistent. But over time, after a few years of continuous visitation, the leopards gradually became habituated enough to give some great sightings. Through the years, Wilpattu has become increasingly popular, especially with wildlife purist who seek more private and quieter moments compared to Yala which can tend to be congested and crowded.<a href="https://www.classicsrilanka.com/blog/2021/06/11/top-5-places-in-sri-lanka-to-see-leopards/">Read More</a></p><br>
            <h3>Kumana National Park</h3>
            <p>Kumana, the land of mystery and awe is located on the far eastern corner of the island. It is connected to Yala and is part of the same ecosystem. But due to the access and location, it is quite a long drive to reach compared to Yala. Kumana was initially famous as a bird sanctuary with many species of birds nesting in the waters of Kumana Villu. But in the last decade or so, there has been an increasing number of leopard sightings in the park. The legends say the leopards of Kumana are known to be “man-eaters” and the leopards of Lenama (an area in the park) are mythically known to be larger and deadlier. But the reality is that these two are the same leopards that you see in Yala. But there have been cases of man-eaters in the park which are more than in many other parts of the island. In 2019 a construction worker was taken and eaten by a large male, who subsequently attacked and severely injured another individual who went to retrieve the body of the victim. Thereafter in 2020, another leopard attacked a farmer in the nearby area of Panama while sleeping in his watch hut. The man succumbed to his injuries. The same leopard thereafter attacked a few men on patrol at night in the fringes of their farms.<a href="https://www.classicsrilanka.com/blog/2021/06/11/top-5-places-in-sri-lanka-to-see-leopards/">Read More</a></p>

            <h2>THREATS FOR LEOPARDS</h2>
            <div class="info">
              <p>The Leopard (Panthera pardus, Linnaeus, 1758) is the most secretive and elusive of the large carnivores, and also the shrewdest. Pound for pound, it is the strongest climber of the larger cats and is capable of killing prey far larger than itself. However, the leopard is the smallest member of the genus Panthera, which includes the Lion, Tiger and Jaguar. Historically, the leopard had a wide distribution across eastern and southern Asia and Africa, from Siberia to South Africa, with fragmented populations in the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka, Indochina, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. Sadly, the range has decreased radically due to over hunting and loss of habitat.</p>

            <h2>Habitat Loss</h2>
            <img src="images/images4/1.jpg" alt="Image of Habitat Loss of a leopard"><br>
            <p>Conservation status, The Sri Lankan leopard is listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The main threats to their population include habitat loss due to deforestation, fragmentation of their habitat and poaching for their fur and body parts.</p><br>
            <p>Leopards face habitat loss due to human activities like deforestation and urban expansion. As their homes vanish, leopards lose access to food and safe spaces. This leads to conflicts with humans, as leopards may venture into populated areas in search of sustenance. The consequences include a decline in leopard populations, disturbance of ecosystems, and increased human-leopard conflicts.</p><br>
            <p>Efforts to reduce this threat involve creating protected areas and wildlife corridors, allowing leopards to move between habitats. Conservation organizations work to raise awareness about the importance of leopard habitats and promote sustainable land use. Collaborations with local communities aim to find solutions that benefit both humans and leopards, fostering coexistence. Additionally, stricter enforcement of anti-poaching measures helps safeguard these elusive big cats and their habitats.</p>

                <h2>Hunting Leopards</h2>
                <img src="images/images4/2.jpeg" alt="Image of a leopard's leather"><br>
                <p>The leopard (Panthera pardus) is the smallest of the four great predatory cat species in the genus Panthera. Despite their smaller size, they are fully capable of taking enormous prey due to their massive skulls, which facilitate powerful jaw muscles. The Ceylon leopard or Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is a subspecies of the genus Panthera pardus.</p><br>
                <p>Hunting leopards, driven by various factors like demand for their skins and bones, poses severe consequences for their survival. These majestic creatures face the threat of extinction due to illegal poaching and habitat loss. The consequences extend beyond leopards, disrupting ecosystems as they play a crucial role in maintaining balance by controlling prey populations.</p><br>
                <p>To reduce this threat, conservation efforts focus on enforcing strict anti-poaching measures and safeguarding leopard habitats. Governments and organizations collaborate to implement laws against illegal hunting, imposing severe penalties to deter poachers. Conservationists also engage local communities in leopard protection initiatives, fostering awareness about the importance of preserving these big cats and their habitats.</p><br>
                <p>Furthermore, programs promoting sustainable land use and alternative livelihoods help address the root causes of habitat destruction. By establishing protected areas and wildlife corridors, conservationists aim to ensure leopards have safe spaces to roam freely. Education and community involvement are key components in the ongoing struggle to safeguard these iconic species, fostering a harmonious coexistence between humans and leopards in the wild.</p>
